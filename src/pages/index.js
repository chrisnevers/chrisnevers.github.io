							I am particularly interested in compilers
							and statically typed, functional programming languages. I graduated from UMass Lowell
							with a Bachelors in Computer Science. In my free time,
							I enjoy composing/playing music on guitar and piano. I'm really
							interested in harmony and writing cool non-diatonic progressions.
							I also like reading philosophy, horror & poetry, and spending time with my bunnies üê∞
